Virtual Workbench Lab: Upgrade/ Install GPU and Daisy-Chain Monitors

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/ukXAU9UumY4)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this activity, you are upgrading an existing computer to serve as a CAD workstation for a new employee. The workstation must be fitted with a new CAD-optimized PCIe 4.0 x16 graphics adapter with 4 GB video memory and cabled to a dual daisy-chained monitor setup using DisplayPort connectors. The workstation has tool-free access to the system board, but adapter cards must be secured using a screw.

This activity is designed to test your understanding of and ability to apply content examples in the following CompTIA A+ objective:

3.1 Explain basic cable types and their connectors, features, and purposes.
3.4 Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards.

# Step-by-Step Walk-Through with Screenshots

## 1. Introduction
**Description**: Upgrade an existing computer to serve as a CAD workstation by installing a CAD-optimized PCIe 4.0 x16 graphics adapter and setting up a dual daisy-chained monitor configuration using DisplayPort connectors.

### Objective:
- Install a new GPU with 4 GB video memory.
- Configure dual monitors with DisplayPort.

## 2. Preparing the Workstation
**Step 1**: Ensure the workstation is powered off and unplugged.
